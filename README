Sharded, memcached counter for Google App Engine

This is one way of implementing counters based on a Google best practices talk:
http://sites.google.com/site/io/building-scalable-web-applications-with-google-app-engine

It shards a counter to decrease contentions on writes.  Rather than use a
Model for the counter configuration as in the Google example, this version
uses a memcached counter that can be fed with an expandable shard count.

Memcache is used for caching counts, although you can force non-cached 
counts.

Usage:
    hits = Counter('hits')
    hits.increment()
    my_hits = hits.count
    hits.get_count(nocache=True)  # Forces non-cached count.
    hits.decrement()
    hits.delete()                 # Deletes all associated shards.

For an example of its use, you can see the Tag model in the Bloog open-source
blog software for App Engine (http://github.com/DocSavage/bloog).
